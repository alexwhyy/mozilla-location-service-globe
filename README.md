# üåê Mozilla Location Service WebGL Globe
### üì° A look at the Mozilla Location Service with WebGL Globe

The [Mozilla Location Service](https://location.services.mozilla.com)(MLS) is an open-source location service provided by the folks at Mozilla. This visualization attempts illustrate the scale of this project and connectivity hotspots around the globe and is powered by the [WebGL Globe](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe) framework; an open-source project created by Google.

#### Demo: [alexyuan.me/project/mls-globe](https://alexyuan.me/project/mls-globe)

The code which powers the demo is a tiny bit different than what you would find in the repository. A few changes needed to be made in order for things to work out smoothly on the web server.
